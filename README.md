To Do:

1. Equals method for board so that contains method works for our visited HashSet. Base it on the block HashSet.
2. HashCode method for board so that we can hash the boards correctly.
3. A way to check if the goal configuration matches the current board. So perhaps a method within Board or within solver
   named isComplete? This will check if the 2x2 blocks are in the right spot.

4. Look up search algorithms like aStar and bStar

sliding block algorithm thing
